# Documentation Site Template

Welcome to the Documentation Site Template - a simple, clean template for creating documentation sites with authentication.

## 🔐 Authentication

This site requires authentication to access the full documentation. Use one of the following credentials:

### Available Accounts:
- **Username**: `admin` | **Password**: `admin123`
- **Username**: `user` | **Password**: `user123`  
- **Username**: `demo` | **Password**: `demo123`

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Public Facade**: The site appears as a simple documentation template
2. **Login Required**: Users must authenticate to access the full content
3. **Authenticated Content**: After login, users see the real documentation and system access

## 📁 Structure

```
docs/
├── index.html              # Main page with login system
├── getting-started.md      # Getting started guide
├── installation.md         # Installation instructions
├── contributing.md         # Contributing guidelines
└── README.md              # This file
```

## 🔧 Features

- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with smooth animations
- **Session Management**: Login state persists across browser sessions
- **Secure Access**: Simple client-side authentication system
- **Real System Integration**: Links to admin dashboard, FTP, SSH, and plugin system

## 🛡️ Security Note

This is a demonstration system with client-side authentication. In production, you should:
- Use server-side authentication
- Implement proper session management
- Add HTTPS encryption
- Use secure password hashing

## 🚀 Deployment

This template is ready for GitHub Pages deployment:

1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`

## 📚 Documentation

After logging in, you'll have access to:
- Getting Started Guide
- API Documentation
- Admin Dashboard
- FTP Access
- SSH Access
- Plugin System
