# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

##  Problem Identified
Your builds were not being sent to Vercel due to several configuration issues:

1. **Missing Vercel Token**: No authentication token configured
2. **Incomplete Build Configuration**: `vercel.json` missing build commands
3. **Workflow Trigger Issues**: Deployment workflow only triggered on specific file changes
4. **Missing Environment Variables**: Build failing due to required env vars

##  Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm ci",
  // ... rest of configuration
}
```

### 2. Created New Deployment Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml`
- **Triggers**: All pushes to main branch
- **Features**: 
  - Automatic environment variable setup
  - Better error handling
  - Clear deployment feedback

### 3. Updated Existing Workflows
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-secret.yml`
  - Removed path restrictions
  - Added token validation
  - Better error messages

- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  - Added environment variables to build step
  - Ensures builds work in CI/CD

### 4. Environment Variables Fixed
Added required environment variables to all build steps:
- `SITE_TITLE=BeamFlow Documentation`
- `SITE_DESCRIPTION=Comprehensive documentation for the BeamFlow Unreal Engine plugin`
- `SITE_URL=https://Millsy102.github.io/docssitetemplate`
- `NODE_ENV=production`

##  Required Action

### You Need to Add Vercel Token to GitHub Secrets:

1. **Get Vercel Token**:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
   - Create new token named "GitHub Actions Deployment"
   - Copy the token (starts with `vercel_`)

2. **Add to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/Millsy102/docssitetemplate/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste your Vercel token

3. **Optional (Recommended)**:
   - Add `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` and `VERCEL_ORG_ID` for better control

##  Test Deployment

### Option 1: Manual Trigger
1. Go to Actions tab in your repository
2. Select "Deploy to Vercel" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

### Option 2: Push to Main
1. Make any change to your code
2. Commit and push to main branch
3. Workflow will automatically trigger

##  Expected Results

After adding the Vercel token, you should see:
-  Successful builds in GitHub Actions
-  Automatic deployments to Vercel
-  Your site live at `docssitetemplate.vercel.app`
-  No more "No Deployment" message in Vercel dashboard

##  Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
2. Verify Vercel token has correct permissions
3. Ensure Vercel project exists and is properly configured
4. Check that the domain is set up correctly in Vercel

##  Next Steps

1. Add the Vercel token to GitHub secrets
2. Test the deployment manually
3. Verify the site is live at your Vercel domain
4. Monitor future deployments on push to main

The configuration is now properly set up for automatic Vercel deployments!
